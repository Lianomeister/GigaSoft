# Showcase: Nick

Commands:
- `nick <player> <newName>`
- `nick-skin <player> <skinName>`

Behavior:
- Stores nickname and skin alias in plugin storage.
- Sends in-game feedback to target player.

Limitations:
- Real tablist/overhead name replacement and true skin swap need host-level integration.
- This showcase demonstrates command UX + persistence flow.
